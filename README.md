## Learning Outcomes

- Follow TDD principles: write tests and then the code to pass them
- Work with a partner across both of your machines

## Prerequisites:
- Install `pytest` (follow the steps in Exercise 0 of [mark-induction-proj--writing-tests](https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-induction-proj--writing-tests))

## Key themes

This exercise is about how to collaborate across machines with GitHub so you will need to work with your partner. 

At every step, try to predict the response of git status before checking it.

Make sure to commit your code regularly and push to remote. Continue switching between the two machines (and so you will need to keep GitHub up to date) through the exercises.

We will be practicing TDD throughout these exercises - write your tests first and then write the code required to pass them. We will be completing challenges working with strings to practice this. After, please continue using similar methods to approach other katas.

## Exercise 0: Set up and initialise your local repository (Machine A)

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** You are able to create the directory using the command line and initialise a local repository.

- Create a new directory within `Academy`
- Initialise a new git repository within it
- Create a sub-directory `src` (short for "source")

## Exercise 1: Write the first tests for `capitalise_string` and push to GitHub (Machine A)

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** You have written your first tests and pushed them to a remote repository.

- Create a python file within it `main.py`
- Make an initial commit
- In `main.py`, define a function `capitalise_string` which takes a single string parameter. To begin with, make it return that same string
- Create a python file `main_test.py` which we will use to test the program
- Write a test for the function `capitalise_string`: check that it returns a given word in capitals
- Commit your first test
- Write three more tests for `capitalise_string` giving it other words
- Run your tests using `pytest` - you will see that they fail
- The next time you run `git status` after having ran your tests you will see the sub-directory `__pycache__`. In simplified terms, this contains the byte code produced by the interpreter when running the python script. We do not need to include this in our git repo and so we want to ignore it. We can choose certain files or folders to ignore by specifying them in a file called `.gitignore`.
- Create a `.gitignore` file at the top level (outside of `src`). Inside this file put:

```
__pycache__
.pytest_cache 
```
- This means that folders matching each of those names (and their contents) will be ignored - they won't be included in the git repo and so won't be shared via GitHub. The `.pytest_cache ` is a hidden folder containing a cache from the tests.
- Run `git status` again and see that `__pycache__` is no longer included
- Commit your work and continue to commit regularly as we go along
- Create a new repository on GitHub
- Push your work to the remote repository
- Notice how the `__pycache__` and `.pytest_cache` folders are not included in the remote repository (because they are listed in `.gitignore`)
- Send the url of the repository to your partner

## Exercise 2: Clone the repo onto a different machine and make `capitalise_string` pass the tests (Machine B)

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** You have cloned the repository onto a second machine, written the function body to pass the tests and pushed back to remote.

- Clone the repository onto the other member of the pair's machine.
- Investigate the files - notice how the setup of the repository is preserved , i.e. both `main.py` and `main_test.py` are within the `src` sub-directory just like on the original machine.
- Investigate the git log - see that all of the commits on your partner's machine are also present and viewable here.
- Run the tests with `pytest` - they will fail again
- Write the function body of `capitalise_string` so that it passes the initial tests.
- Check that it passes the tests.
- Push to remote - you should do this regularly so that it is always available online (for your own benefit if your laptop were to have a problem and for your team's benefit so they can see the most recent version).

## Exercise 3: Pull the latest changes onto the original machine and write some more tests (Machine A)

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** An expanded test suite.

- Switch back to Machine A.
- Pull the latest changes in using `git pull`. This updates your local repository to include all the commits from the remote repository, and you can check this by running `git log` and seeing all of the commits made by your partner.
- Run the tests again to prove that they are passing.
- Expand the test suite - add tests to check `capitalise_string` works with a multi-word phrase.
- What happens if the input includes numbers or punctuation in the string? Add tests for this.
- Run your tests: if they fail then improve your function to resolve this.
- Commit and push to remote - keep doing this regularly.

From here onwards, keep committing and pushing. Swap between machines regularly to take turns.

## Exercise 4: Lower case strings

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** A function and relevant tests for it to change a string into lowercase.

Now let's make a new function `decapitalise_string` which does the opposite of `capitalise_string`: it should turn any capital letters into lower case.

- Similarly to before, start by defining the function and making it return something abritrary such as its input. It should take a string as its only parameter.
- Write a thorough test suite for this function - think about cases such as number, punctuation, words with spaces, and anything else which may come up.
- Write the function itself and ensure it passes all your tests.
- Write additional tests if you thought of any in the meantime.

## Exercise 5: Capitalise the first letter of every word in a string

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** A function and relevant tests for it to capitalise the first letter of every word in a string. 

Make a new function to capitalise the first letter of every word in a string (and make all the other letters in that string) and write the revelant tests for it. 

If you use helper functions to achieve this then you should also write tests for them.

Example: if we input `hello world` then we would expect an output of `Hello World`.

### Extension: Title case

In title case, most words are capitalised except for "minor words" such as `the` or `a`. Minor words are only capitlised if they appear are the first or last words in the title (or in our case string). More info can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case).

Make a function to turn strings into title case. Find a list of minor words online or list some of your own. Test the function with common book or film titles. 

## Exercise 6: Reverse a string

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** A function and relevant tests for it to reverse a string.

Make a new function which reverses strings. Continue using TDD and so write the tests for it first!

## Exercise 7: Add a README

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** A README which describes your project.

Write a README, which every project should have. READMEs should be put at the top level of your repo (so not in the src folder) and should be a markdown file. GitHub shows the preview of the README in effect as the cover page of the repo. It should explain the project and give credit to sources or inspiration (and so include a link to this repo). There are lots of articles online about how to write a good README but this is a skill we can develop over time.


## Extension:

Continue practicing TDD to solve challenges and collaborating via GitHub. We recommend looking at katas available on CodeWar for these challenges.
